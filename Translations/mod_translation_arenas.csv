ARENAS_WILMA_ENTRY,"Hello, sweetie."
ARENAS_WILMA_EXIT,Take care!
ARENAS_CLEEO_SPAWN1,"Another pointless ""convenience"" tool... "
ARENAS_CLEEO_SPAWN2,Huh?
ARENAS_CLEEO_ENTRY1,Fine. I'll demonstrate my superior capabilities.
ARENAS_CLEEO_ENTRY2,Though the probability of any human in this room learning anything from this is near zero.

ARENAS_HEATHER_SPAWN,We're coming to you live from Harbourtown's own Town Hall with a special report!
ARENAS_HEATHER_ENTRY,"According to our sources, this arena's about to get blown away!"
ARENAS_HEATHER_EXIT,I guess the barometer went a bit too low that time!
ARENAS_JUDAS_SPAWN,These rookies have no idea how to survive out here.
ARENAS_JUDAS_ENTRY,This is what happens when you recklessly charge into battle. 
ARENAS_JUDAS_EXIT,I guess a little fun isn't such a bad thing.
ARENAS_LODESTEIN_SPAWN1,There! That should keep it going a while longer.
ARENAS_LODESTEIN_SPAWN2,Now then...

ARENAS_ZEDD_SPAWN,"...wha? Oh, right. The thing."
ARENAS_ZEDD_ENTRY1,"Well, {player}. I hope you haven't been slacking off too much.. "
ARENAS_ZEDD_ENTRY2,Can't let the trainees see a Captain not pulling their weight. 
ARENAS_ZEDD_EXIT,"Heh. Alright, I guess I did fall asleep at the wheel there."
ARENAS_IANTHE_SPAWN,Quite the lively crowd in here...
ARENAS_IANTHE_ENTRY,I see you've all been busy back here. Maybe I should be assigning more patrol duties.
ARENAS_IANTHE_EXIT1,"I'm glad to see you've continued to improve as well. You've come so far, {player} and {partner}. "

ARENAS_IDLE_TRAINEE7_BANTER2,She just kind of started yelling some stuff from the balcony and nobody questioned it. 
ARENAS_IDLE_TRAINEE8_BANTER1,The arena rewards just go back to fused material after 78 consecutive victories.
ARENAS_IDLE_TRAINEE8_BANTER2,It's like somebody got tired of listing rewards.
